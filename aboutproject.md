This e-commerce project is a web application built using Django, focused on selling shoes online. It features a product catalog where users can browse various shoes with details 
like images, descriptions, prices, and sizes. Customers can register, log in, and manage their accounts, as well as add items to a shopping cart and place orders seamlessly.
An admin dashboard is included to manage products, track orders, and oversee user activity. The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth and accessible user 
experience across devices.
